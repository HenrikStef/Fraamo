# Fraamo

A simple desktop application to share part of the desktop for use with e.g. Skype’s program share functionality.

**Problem**

You should think having an ultrawide monitor is all fun and games. 
However, when it comes to sharing your desktop with others (who do not have so much screen real estate) through e.g. Skype, it’s a whole different story. Skype provides you two options for sharing content:
- Share the whole desktop, which is a pain for the guy in the other end, who will need to bring out the big magnifying glass. You could modify the screen resolution – but that kinda defeats the purpose of a big screen.
- Share one program at a time. This quickly gets old, when you need to show more than program.

**Solution**

To remedy this, I put together a small desktop application, Fraamo, which basically is a frame and a transparent canvas. You can then use Skype’s “share a program” functionality to share Fraamo and thereby a specific area of the desktop.

*Known limitations:*
* *Cannot show context menus and Aero effects (e.g. Alt+Tab application switch menu). Shows a black rectangle instead.*
* *Cannot drag window out of maximized state*
